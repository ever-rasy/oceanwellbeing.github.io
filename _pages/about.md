The goal of the workshop is to encompass and understand a holistic approach to wellbeing for oceans 

Environmental changes in our oceans cause disparate health, well-being, economic and other impacts that vary across contexts and communities. But scientists and decision makers still lack the information necessary to implement equitable solutions that do not further disadvantage the marginalized, the disempowered, and those otherwise unable to equally access or benefit from oceans.

Using a unique interdisciplinary approach that combines social science and governance research, we study the changes, responses and solutions to societal issues of oceans. Our research informs evidence-based policies and bridges the gap between decision makers, policy makers and the people most dependent on the oceans.

From South East Asian sea nomads and Japanese oyster farmers to Pacific Island nations and U.S. coastal communities, our researchers aim to co-create transformation that directly benefits those impacted by misrepresentation and unjust ocean management and development.
